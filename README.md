## About me  

Hello! My name is Omar, I'm a Frontend Developer. I have worked on some projects, making responsive websites, landing pages, online stores.  I consider myself a responsible person who likes to work in a team. 

I am passionate about the world of technology, that is why I like to keep myself updated. I am currently learning technologies such as React, Jest and Tailwind in Platzi 💚 

> Never stop learning !
